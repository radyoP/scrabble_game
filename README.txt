Simple scrabble game for school project. Should serve as testing enviroment for bots.

If you run Game.py without any arguments, it will try to find scrabble_player module in directory.

Use Game.py -h for aditional informations



Don't study the code much. It's horrible and I know it. Also, I can't be sure, everything works as it should,
but it's better than nothing. 

I've encountered some problems on Windows, but strangely enough, it worked in PyCharm, which should use same interpreter as Windows. 
I'd recomend using Python 3.x
Work's fine on Ubuntu
